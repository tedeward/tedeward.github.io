```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Data Entry

```{r data}
jmen <- read.table("jmen.txt", header = TRUE)
```

##Imitation Graph

```{r graph}
hair_table<- table(jmen$Hair)
barplot(hair_table, col = c("Black", "Gold", "Lightsalmon4", "Red"), main= "Hair Color of Sampled JMen", xlab = "Hair Colors", ylab= "Number of Men", names.arg = c("Black", "Blond(e)", "Brown", "Red"))
```

I was able to imitate the graph nearly identically apart from the colors, which were difficult to discern under R's color scheme.
